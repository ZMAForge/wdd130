    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our primary audience is the young and the young at heart. We imagine primarily people in their 20's to 40's who are looking for a thrilling experience out on the water. 
      We are prepared for all walks of life, whether it be a small knit group of friends, a large club, a couple or two, and even large family events. These people will want a fun day with
      little planning on their own parts, as time is a precious comedity. Do to this we offer shuttles, guides, and meals, along with gear necessary. Each of these are optional, making
      the entire experience completely customizeable, and budget friendly. My audience will likely view and place their order on a desktop or laptop, and will refer back to the schedule and other tips 
      via mobile device. This is why we include options to enter a phone number for text reminders after tickets have been purchases in order to help our users stay effortlessely in the know.
      This will allow for quick sharing of information for everyone involved.
