            <section class="card">

                <h3><a href="ice/prophet_cards/nelson.html" target="_blank">Prophet Card</a></h3>
                <p>This was our very first ICE challange. We were tasked with replacating a reference image. We were given fonts, colors, and images and were tasked with manipulating the CSS in order to recreate it.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <img src="images/apostle-spotlight.png" alt="">
                <h3><a href="ice/apostle_spotlight/apostles.html" target="_blank">Apostle Spotlight</a></h3>
                <p>Our second ICE challange. This one required us to manipulate an image in the background as well 15 different profile esque images. These images also had a variety of individual sizing and spacing, providing a decent challenge. It was also the first time we implement the "grid" element.</p>

            <section class="card">
                <img src="images/iceexample.png" alt="A picture of a page detailing favorite talks with a form to suggest new ones.">
                <h3><a href="ice/favorite_devo/favdevo.html" target="_blank">Favorite Talks</a></h3>
                <p>This was our third ICE challenge, and the first one in which we meant to experiment and make it our own. I decided to opt for an overall more simple look by picking simple elements, with out a lot of variatin in texture and color. Adding the worn paper texture was fun.</p>

            <section class="card" id="valentines">
                <img src="images/valentines.png" alt="">
                <h3><a href="ice/valentines/index.html" target="_blank">Valentines</a></h3>
                <p>Our fourth ICE challenge and we were only given about 30 minutes in class to style the page. This was very challenging simply because of the time crunch. We were not allowed mess with the HTML, which bothered me because the heading "candy" doesn't really make sense. This assignment is based on the nearest holiday so we got valentines, while other classes get like Halloween.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <img src="images/map-grid.png" alt="">
                <h3><a href="ice/grid_flags/flags.html" target="_blank">Grid Flag</a></h3>
                <p>Our fifth ICE challenge. This one was entirely focused on manipulating grid in order to create various flags. This was one was my favorite to do, it was rather easy to do after you remember you can have as many rows and columns as you would like to have.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <img src="images/gallery.png" alt="">
                <h3><a href="ice/gallery/gallery.html" target="_blank">Gallery</a></h3>
                <p>Our sixth ICE challenge. This one was focused entirely on reducing file sizes in order to optimize our page. We talked about different ways to go about that, such as changing image format and/or reducing image size. The goal of this is so that our pages will load quickly so that people won't click off.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <img src="images/positioning.png" alt="">
                <h3><a href="ice/positioning/positioning.html" target="_blank">Positioning</a></h3>
                <p>Our most recent ICE challenge. The practice again how to use grid and how to utilize float for wrapping text around an element. These assignments are beginning to have me believe that grid might just be the most powerful thing when building pages.</p>
