        <p>BYU-Idaho is a comfortable place to learn and grow as a diciple of jesus christ. With weekly devotionals, capstone religion classes, and a constant spirit of prayer, there is constant spiritual guidance to be found.
            It is for this reason that many students choose this location over it's sister schools.
            Make sure to dress warm as Idaho tends to get cold over the winter!
